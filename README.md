# challenge1
We are going to implement one sample basic calculator app. Feel free to pick any programming language you feel comfortable with.
Step1: Make an initial git commit on the master branch with a sample calculator file.
Step2: Now we are going to implement addition and subtraction features in the calculator app. So implement those features in their respective branches. Branches can be named as feature/addition and feature/subtraction. Please use only one calculator file.
Step3: Merge those branches one by one.
Output: In the master branch the main file should contain both addition and subtraction logics.
